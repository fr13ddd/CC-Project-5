      This project is a web-based speech recognition tool that uses the
      p5.speech.js library for speech-to-text conversion. This tool captures the
      user's voice input in real time and converts it into written text. The
      user simply speaks through the microphone and the system displays the
      corresponding text, which is very useful for people who need to quickly
      transcribe meeting minutes, lectures or daily conversations. Whether you
      are an educator, student, journalist or any professional who needs to
      convert verbal information into written form, you will find this tool
      extremely useful. By increasing productivity, it helps users save valuable
      time and also reduces manual transcription errors.
